The StudioCMS rendering system is dynamic based on the current pageType.

Example Catch-all route where the current page is grabbed from the SDK and the page data is passed to the renderer, in this case we are using the default `studiocms/markdown` pageType configured in the page settings, and wrapping that in a Layout like we do with the `@studiocms/blog` plugin. a pageBuilder plugin for example, may come without a standard layout, but instead intend on you designing the whole thing within the builder like you would on other CMS systems.

<Aside>
Please note that using our rendering system requires you to have a studiocms plugin that provides a renderer, such as `@studiocms/md`, `@studiocms/html` or a custom plugin that provides a renderer for your content type. The renderer will handle the rendering of the content based on the pageType defined in your StudioCMS configuration.

const { data: page } = await runSDK(SDKCoreJs.GET.page.bySlug(slug))

if (!page) {
	return new Response(null, { status: 404 });
}

const { title, description, heroImage } = page;

		<StudioCMSRenderer data={page} />
