The `sqld` ("SQL daemon") project is a server mode for libSQL created by Turso.  This guide will go over setting up and configuring `sqld` to work from a docker container for your StudioCMS project.

<ReadMore>Learn more about `sqld` using their [Documentation][sql-docs]</ReadMore>

## Prerequisites

- [Docker and Docker Compose][docker-docs] (either running on a server or locally)
- [OpenSSL][openssl-docs] installed
- StudioCMS CLI (available from the root of your StudioCMS project)

The final file structure will look something like this if testing locally:

<FileTree>

- docker-compose.yml
- data/
- keys/
- my-studiocms-project/
  - astro.config.mjs
  - studiocms.config.mjs
  - package.json
  - src/

</FileTree>

## Generate Private and Public keys

From inside the `keys` directory run the following command to create a new PKCS#8-encoded Ed25519 key-pair: 

```bash
openssl pkey -in ./libsql.pem -pubout -out ./libsql.pub
```

This will generate a new PKCS#8 key-pair that will be used for the `sqld` server.

## Generate your JWT token

Navigate to your studiocms project directory and run the following command:

<PackageManagers pkg='studiocms' type='run' args='crypto gen-jwt "../keys/libsql.pem" -c "iss=admin" -e 31556926' />

The output is the JWT auth token encrypted with your private key, which will be used for libSQL authentication. Keep in mind that the token will be valid for 1 year!

### Update your StudioCMS `.env` with the following:

```sh
ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL=http://localhost:8080 # This should point to your docker server/local system
ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN= # paste your base64URL encoded JWT auth token here
```

## Setting up the Docker container

Create a new `docker-compose.yml` file outside of the StudioCMS project directory, for the libSQL instance. At this point you have two options to configure libSQL authentication:

- Using the public key file itself
- Using the JWT token as an environment variable (the same ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN value you used in your .env file)

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Public Key File">

```yml
services:
  libsql:
    image: ghcr.io/tursodatabase/libsql-server:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "5001:5001"
    environment:
      - SQLD_NODE=primary
      - SQLD_AUTH_JWT_KEY_FILE=/home/.ssh/libsql.pub
    volumes:
      - ./data/libsql:/var/lib/sqld
      - ./keys/libsql.pub:/home/.ssh/libsql.pub
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="JWT Token">

```yml
services:
  libsql:
    image: ghcr.io/tursodatabase/libsql-server:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "5001:5001"
    environment:
      - SQLD_NODE=primary
      - SQLD_AUTH_JWT_KEY=paste your JWT token here
    volumes:
      - ./data/libsql:/var/lib/sqld
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Starting Everything up

<Steps>

1. Start the Docker container:

   From the base directory (or the server if you went that route) run the following command to start the libSQL Server container

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. Sync your StudioCMS database schema:

   Move into your StudioCMS project directory and run the following command:

   <PackageManagers type="exec" args="astro db push --remote" />

3. Follow the first time setup for your new database.

   - See [Getting Started][getting-started]
   
   :::note
   If this is not your first time setting up a StudioCMS project you may need to enable the `dbStartPage` option in your `studiocms.config.mjs`
   :::

</Steps>

## Final Thoughts

If you are looking for an option for Self-hosting your own libSQL database with StudioCMS `sqld` is a viable option and is not very complicated to get up and running if you do it the right way, following this guide provides you with a secure libSQL server to use alongside your StudioCMS project.
