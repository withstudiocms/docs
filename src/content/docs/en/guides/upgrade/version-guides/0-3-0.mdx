<QuickUpdate />

## Breaking changes

- Removes the following deprecated and unused virtual modules.
  - `studiocms:astro-config/adapter`
  - `studiocms:auth/utils/getLabelForPermissionLevel`
  - `virtual:studiocms/sdk/env`

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Replaces `chalk` with `node:util`'s `styleText` for StudioCMS CLI.
- updates StudioCMS dependencies
- Fixes issue with `pg` and `mysql2` being required to be installed when they should be optional
- Fix client regex in frontend to allow for slashes within a slug, but not on the outside. This unblocks creating pages under sub-paths just using the slug (e.g., `docs/getting-started`) and only affects client-side validation.
- Removes legacy email domain verification code
- Fixes default 404 route rendering
