## Breaking Changes

- New Hook based plugin system - See the updated [Plugins Docs][plugin-doc] for more info.

## Bug fixes

- Refactor `gen-jwt` command - See the updated [CLI docs][cli-doc] for more info.

<Aside title="Note">
Please note that in `beta.16` we introduced a breaking change with the password hashing algorithm. While previous passwords will still work, we recommend that users update their passwords after upgrading to `beta.17`. The legacy password hashing support will be removed in a future release.
