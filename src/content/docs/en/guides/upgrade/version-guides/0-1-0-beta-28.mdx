## Breaking Changes
- Deprecates and hides the "Hide Index Page" setting from dashboard. Users who previously relied on this setting should migrate to another method.
- Implements new rendering system, allowing plugins to augment the rendering pipeline with prefix, suffix, or simple component augmentation. This is a breaking change for plugin authors who have implemented custom renderers.
  <ReadMore>See the [Plugin Renderer Documentation][plugin-renderer-docs] for more details on how to migrate existing renderers to the new system.</ReadMore>
- Deprecates the legacy StudioCMSSiteConfig, StudioCMSMailerConfig, and StudioCMSNotificationSettings tables to be fully removed in a future release.
  - Users will need to run `astro db push --remote` to ensure their DB schemas are up-to-date.

## New Features
- Introduces a new email template editor and preview feature in the StudioCMS dashboard, allowing users to customize email templates directly from the UI.
- Enables Multi-language support for StudioCMS dashboard.
- Implements a better API route type PluginAPIRoute from the `studiocms/plugins` export for plugin `onCreate`, `onEdit`, and `onDelete` API handlers.
- Reorganizes create and edit content pages, as well as SMTP config page.

## Bug fixes & Improvements
- Updates to `@studiocms/ui@1.0.0-beta.3` and cleanup now unneeded styles.
- Replaces custom CSS search icon with Input component icon prop and removes unused CSS.
- Fixes the form validation parsing of boolean select fields values by transforming the string values to boolean for content management pages.
- Updates feedback button to point to GitHub (temporary measure until astro-feedback integration).
- Fixes zod error parsing for first-time setup api route responses.
- Updates quick user tools, Logout page, and buttons to utilize POST requests.
- Optimizes middleware cache for improved performance.
- Refactors internal file structure of Astro frontend pages and api endpoints to simplify long-term maintenance.
- Improve page creation and edit data processing for better consistency and reliability.
- Move avatar loading to client-side to eliminate render blocking.
