<QuickUpdate />

No major changes in this version, but we have made some optimizations and bug fixes to improve the overall performance and stability of StudioCMS.

## Patch Overview

- **New Features**
  - Introduced a new feedback system in the dashboard.
- **Bug Fixes**
  - Resolved issues with Astro Fonts.
  - Improved keyfile path detection for the [`crypto gen-jwt`](/en/how-it-works/cli/#crypto-gen-jwt) CLI command.
- **Improvements**
  - Replaced [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) with [deepmerge-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge-ts) for better performance.
  - Optimized promise handling in middleware and updated permission level processing.

<Aside title="Note">
Please note that in `beta.16` we introduced a breaking change with the password hashing algorithm. While previous passwords will still work, we recommend that users update their passwords after upgrading to `beta.17`. The legacy password hashing support will be removed in a future release.
