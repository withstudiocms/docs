## New Features

- Refactor CLI to utilize new Effect-ful clack module from `@withstudiocms/effect`
- Migrate CLI to new `@withstudiocms/auth-kit` package
- Setup initial testing for StudioCMS.

## Bug fixes

- Enable the "Draft" toggle on the Edit Page for all pages (including the index page) so the draft field is submitted with the form. Previously the disabled control omitted this field from the payload, preventing changes to draft status.
- Ensure slug is not an empty string, or an invalid slug.
- Rename internal file to avoid confusion with tests during development.
- Correct parameter in CLI add command.
