## Bug fixes

- Fixed First time setup routes that used a unavailable middleware feature during first time setup, causing the first time setup to fail.

<Aside title="Note">
Please note that in `beta.16` we introduced a breaking change with the password hashing algorithm. While previous passwords will still work, we recommend that users update their passwords after upgrading to `beta.20`. The legacy password hashing support will be removed in a future release.
