<QuickUpdate />

## Breaking Changes

- StudioCMS now **only support NodeJS 20 and higher**
- New Config structure, please verify your `studiocms.config.*` file when updating. Config files can also end in `.js`, `.mjs`, `.ts`, `.mts` now! Allowing flexibility, and full type-safety.
   <ReadMore>For more information related to these changes checkout the new [Config Reference][config-doc]</ReadMore>
- Image Service has been migrated to the plugin system. If you were previously using the `cloudinary-js` image service you will need to migrate to utilizing the new [`@studiocms/cloudinary-image-service` plugin][cloudinary-plugin], and configure your [preferredImageService][image-service]
- Integrated [Effect][effect-website], and migrated most of the codebase to an Effect based structure. (old functions have been deprecated to allow migration to new Effects)
- Added support for `@studiocms/web-vitals` to replace `@astrojs/web-vitals` in the future. Note, Astro has deprecated `@astrojs/web-vitals` and asked us to maintain the package, please update to the new package to prevent future issues as we plan to remove support for the old package in a future update.

## Bug fixes

- Removed usage of remote google fonts for the dashboard, resolving potential network blocking issues.

<Aside title="Note">
Please note that in `beta.16` we introduced a breaking change with the password hashing algorithm. While previous passwords will still work, we recommend that users update their passwords after upgrading to `beta.19`. The legacy password hashing support will be removed in a future release.
