StudioCMS `0.1.0-beta.32` introduces several breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes. This guide will help you navigate the upgrade process smoothly.

## Breaking changes
- Replaced `@libsql/kysely-libsql` with `kysely-turso` for Turso database client. If you were using `@libsql/kysely-libsql` in your project, please update your dependencies to use `kysely-turso` instead.
  - **Steps to migrate:**
  <Steps>
  1. Remove `@libsql/kysely-libsql` from your `package.json` dependencies.

     <PackageManagers type="remove" pkg="@libsql/kysely-libsql" />

  2. Install `kysely-turso` by running:

     <PackageManagers type="add" pkg="kysely-turso" />
  </Steps>
- Removes deprecated hideDefaultIndex site config variable from SDK and updates all instances of usage in StudioCMS.
  - Note for anyone previously relying on this feature, it has now been completely removed. Users will need to adjust any code relying on this functionality.
- Migrates table imports to new `@withstudiocms/sdk/tables` export, and updated relevant imports.
- Migrates migration system to StudioCMS SDK and updated imports for Migrator to `@withstudiocms/sdk/migrator`.
