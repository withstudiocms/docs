The StudioCMS SDK is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with StudioCMS programmatically. It provides a set of functions and utilities that allow you to manage and serve your content using Astro DB. It also provides the backbone for the StudioCMS Dashboard.

## Usage

The StudioCMS SDK is available as a virtual module in your Astro project. You can import it using the following syntax:

```ts twoslash
/// <reference types="studiocms/v/types" />
// ---cut---
import { SDKCore, SDKCoreJs, runSDK } from 'studiocms:sdk';
```
