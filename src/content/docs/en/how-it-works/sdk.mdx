The StudioCMS SDK is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with StudioCMS programmatically. It provides a set of functions and utilities that allow you to manage and serve your content using Astro DB. It also provides the backbone for the StudioCMS Dashboard, and is built with [Effect](https://effect.website).

## Basic Usage

The StudioCMS SDK is available as a virtual module in your Astro project. You can import and utilize it using the following syntax:

```ts twoslash {"Working with StudioCMS SDK and Effect":4} {"Working with StudioCMS SDK without Effect":16}
/// <reference types="studiocms/v/types" />
// ---cut---
import { SDKCore, SDKCoreJs, runSDK } from 'studiocms:sdk';
import { Effect } from 'studiocms/effect';


// Create the Usable Effect
const pagesEffect = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const sdk = yield* SDKCore;

 // then do something with the SDK
 return yield* sdk.GET.pages()
}).pipe(Effect.provide(SDKCore.Default));

// Convert the Effect into a JS/TS "program"
const pagesResult1 = await runSDK(pagesEffect);


// Just run the SDKCoreJS with the runSDK wrapper!
const pagesResult2 = await runSDK(SDKCoreJs.GET.pages());
```
