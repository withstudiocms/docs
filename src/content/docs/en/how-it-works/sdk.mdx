The StudioCMS SDK is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with StudioCMS programmatically. It provides a set of functions and utilities that allow you to manage and serve your content using Astro DB. It also provides the backbone for the StudioCMS Dashboard.

## Usage

The StudioCMS SDK is available as a virtual module in your Astro project. You can import it using the following syntax:

```ts twoslash
/// <reference types="studiocms/v/types" />
// ---cut---
import { SDKCore, SDKCoreJs, runSDK } from 'studiocms:sdk';
```

The `studioCMSSDK` object provides a set of functions and utilities that allow you to interact with StudioCMS. You can use these functions to create, read, update, and delete content in your Astro project.

The `studioCMSSDKCached` object provides a set of functions and utilities that allow you to interact with the StudioCMS SDK with a caching layer on top. You can use these functions to cache content in your Astro project.
