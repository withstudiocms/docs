A comprehensive Software Development Kit for StudioCMS, providing a unified API for interacting with the CMS core functionality. Built with TypeScript and Effect-ts for type-safety and functional programming patterns, with Kysely DB ([`@withstudiocms/kysely`](/en/ecosystem/packages/kysely/)) for dynamic database storage.

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning">
  This package is primarily intended for internal use by StudioCMS. While you can use it directly in your projects, be aware that it may change without notice as StudioCMS evolves.
