The Package Catalog is a collection of packages by StudioCMS or its community members, that are not included within StudioCMS by default. All packages listed here are verified and tested by the StudioCMS team or its contributors.

Any package labeled as a <Badge text="Plugin" variant="tip"/> is a package that extends the functionality of StudioCMS or its dashboard.

Plugins can also be labeled as <Badge text="Experimental" variant="danger" /> which means the plugin is still early in development and could face major changes to its internals at any time. This plugin may or may not also be ready for usage.
