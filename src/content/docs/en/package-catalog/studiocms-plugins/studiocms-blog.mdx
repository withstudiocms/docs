# Introduction

This plugin enables the StudioCMS Blog features as well as a frontend in your Astro project. It will allow you to create, edit, and delete blog posts from the StudioCMS dashboard.

## Installation

1. Install the package using the following command:

   <PackageManagers pkg="studiocms" type='run' args='add @studiocms/blog' />

2. Your StudioCMS config should now include `@studiocms/blog`:

   ```ts twoslash title="studiocms.config.mjs" ins={2, 6}
   import { defineStudioCMSConfig } from 'studiocms/config';
   import blog from '@studiocms/blog';

    export default defineStudioCMSConfig({
      plugins: [
        blog(),
      ],
    });
   ```
## Usage

### What does this plugin do?

This integration will add the following new routes to your StudioCMS-controlled front-end:

- `/[...slug]` - The main blog page that lists all StudioCMS Pages.
- `/blog` - The main blog page that lists all blog posts.
- `/blog/[slug]` - The individual blog post page.
- `/rss.xml` - The RSS feed for your blog posts.
