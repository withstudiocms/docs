For StudioCMS to work correctly, you must set up the correct environment variables. These variables are essential for establishing a secure connection to Astro DB and authenticating with the StudioCMS API. Without correctly configuring these environment variables, the application will not function as intended.

You can create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the required environment variables. The `.env` file is a text file that contains key-value pairs of environment variables. The environment variables are read by the application at runtime.

For future reference on how to work with environment variables within Astro you can checkout [Environment Variables](https://docs.astro.build/guides/environment-variables) from the Astro documentation.

## Required Environment Variables

In order to use StudioCMS, there are a few required environment variables that you must set up in your `.env` file.

### Database URL and Token for `@astrojs/db`

- `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL` - The connection URL to your libSQL server
- `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN` - The app token for your libSQL server

```bash title=".env"
ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL=libsql://your.server.io
ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN=eyJh...RUCg
```

<ReadMore>For more information about `@astrojs/db` see, the [Astro docs for Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/)</ReadMore>

### Encryption Key for `@studiocms/auth`

`CMS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - A secure encryption key for encrypting sensitive data

```bash title=".env"
CMS_ENCRYPTION_KEY="wqR+w...sRcg=="
```

<Aside type="note" title="Use OpenSSL">
You can generate a secure encryption key using the following command: 
```bash
openssl rand --base64 16
```
