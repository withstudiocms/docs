You are now ready to move on to creating your StudioCMS project!

## Creating a StudioCMS project

<Tabs syncKey='install-method'>

<TabItem label="StudioCMS CLI" icon="rocket">

    <Steps>

    1. Creating a StudioCMS Project using the create command

        To create a new Astro project with StudioCMS using one of our pre-made templates, simply run the following command in your terminal:

            <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="studiocms@latest" />

        After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project with StudioCMS in the specified directory.

        Afterward, you will be prompted to follow the next steps, which includes ensuring your environment variables are set correctly and running the project to complete the setup.

    2. After running the CLI, make sure that your `astro.config.mjs` fle is correctly configured:

       ```ts title="astro.config.mjs" {2-3,8,10}
       import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
       import node from '@astrojs/node';
       import studioCMS from 'studiocms';

       export default defineConfig({
           site: 'https://demo.studiocms.dev/',
           output: 'server',
           adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
           integrations: [
               studioCMS(),
           ],
       });
       ```

    </Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Astro Method" icon='astro'>

    <Steps>

    1. Creating a new Astro project

        To create a new Astro project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

            <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="astro@latest" />

        After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project in the specified directory.

        You should see a “Liftoff confirmed. Explore your project!” message followed by some recommended next steps.

        `cd` into your new project directory to begin using Astro. 

        ```bash
        cd my-project
        ```

        If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

    2. To add the StudioCMS integration to your project, you'll need to install the StudioCMS package and it's dependencies:

       <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="add node studiocms" />

    3. After installing the package, make sure that your `astro.config.mjs` file is correctly importing and calling the integration:

       ```ts title="astro.config.mjs" {2-3,8,10}
       import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
       import node from '@astrojs/node';
       import studioCMS from 'studiocms';

       export default defineConfig({
           site: 'https://demo.studiocms.dev/',
           output: 'server',
           adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
           integrations: [
               studioCMS(),
           ],
       });
       ```

    </Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Manual Method" icon='seti:powershell'>

    <Steps>

    1. Creating a new Astro project

        To create a new Astro project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

            <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="astro@latest" />

        After running the command, you'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Once completed, the CLI will create a new Astro project in the specified directory.

        You should see a “Liftoff confirmed. Explore your project!” message followed by some recommended next steps.

        `cd` into your new project directory to begin using Astro. 

        ```bash
        cd my-project
        ```

        If you skipped the npm install step during the CLI wizard, then be sure to install your dependencies before continuing.

    2. To add the StudioCMS integration to your project, you'll need to install the Astro StudioCMS package and it's dependencies:

       <PackageManagers pkg="@astrojs/node studiocms" />

    3. Update your `astro.config.mjs` file:

       ```ts title="astro.config.mjs" {2-3,8,10}
       import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
       import node from '@astrojs/node'; 
       import studioCMS from 'studiocms';

       export default defineConfig({
           site: 'https://demo.studiocms.dev/',
           output: 'server', 
           adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }), 
           integrations: [
               studioCMS(),
           ],
       });
       ```

    </Steps>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Please note that the `site` option in the `astro.config.mjs` file is required for StudioCMS to work correctly. You can set this to your site's URL or a placeholder URL. (i.e. `https://demo.studiocms.dev/` or `http://localhost:4321/`)

<Aside type="note" title="Adapter Required">
StudioCMS requires an [Astro Adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#server-adapters) to work correctly. Make sure to set an adapter that supports SSR Routes in your `astro.config.mjs` file.
</Aside>

### Configure StudioCMS Database dialect <Badge text='Added in beta.31' variant='success' />

If you are using a database other than `libSQL` you will need to configure the `db` option in your `studiocms.config.mjs` file to specify the correct dialect.

```ts twoslash title="studiocms.config.mjs"
import { defineStudioCMSConfig } from 'studiocms/config';
// ---cut---
export default defineStudioCMSConfig({
  db: {
    dialect: 'postgres', // 'libsql' | 'postgres' | 'mysql'
  },
})
```

#### Ensure database client packages are installed

You will also need to install the necessary database client packages for your chosen database dialect:

<Tabs syncKey='db-setup-method'>     
  <TabItem label="libSQL (default)" icon="database">
    <PackageManagers type='add' pkg="@libsql/client kysely-turso" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="MySQL" icon="database">
    <PackageManagers type='add' pkg="mysql2" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PostgreSQL" icon="database">
    <PackageManagers type='add' pkg="pg" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure StudioCMS rendering <Badge text='Added in beta.22' variant='success' />

StudioCMS requires at least one of the following rendering plugins to be installed and configured within your StudioCMS project:

- [`@studiocms/html`](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-html/) - for HTML rendering
- [`@studiocms/md`](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-md/) - for Markdown rendering
- [`@studiocms/mdx`](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-mdx/) - for MDX rendering
- [`@studiocms/markdoc`](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-markdoc/) - for MarkDoc rendering
- [`@studiocms/wysiwyg`](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-wysiwyg/) - for WYSIWYG rendering
- Or any other community plugin that supports rendering content in StudioCMS.

Any of these plugins can be used to render content in StudioCMS. You can use one or more of these plugins in your project, depending on your needs. They can be installed and configured using the StudioCMS config file.

```ts twoslash title="studiocms.config.mjs"
import { defineStudioCMSConfig } from 'studiocms/config';
import html from '@studiocms/html';
import md from '@studiocms/md';

export default defineStudioCMSConfig({
    plugins: [
        html(),
        md(),
    ],
});
```

<ReadMore>For more information about the available rendering plugins see, [Package Catalog][package-catalog]</ReadMore>

### Configure authentication

StudioCMS's built-in authentication requires at least the [Encryption Key][encryption-key] to be set in your `.env` file.

The following environment variables are required for StudioCMS authentication:

```bash title=".env"
# encryption key for username and password authentication
CMS_ENCRYPTION_KEY="wqR+w...sRcg=="
```

You can generate a secure encryption key using the following command: 

```bash
openssl rand --base64 16
``` 

And set the output as the value for `CMS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

<ReadMore>
For more information about all the available authentication environment variables see, [Environment variables][environment-variables] page.
</ReadMore>

#### Optional: Configure oAuth authentication <Badge text='Revised beta.23' variant='caution' />

StudioCMS supports various oAuth authentication providers, utilizing our plugin system to enable the providers you want to use. To get started, you will need to find a plugin for the provider you want to use, or create your own plugin.

<ReadMore>For more information about the available oAuth authentication plugins see, [Package Catalog][package-catalog]</ReadMore>

For setting up oAuth providers, they require a callback URL. The callback URL is the path where the provider will redirect the user after authentication. 

##### Setting up the callback URL

The callback URL should be set to one of the following paths based on your environment:

| Environment   | Callback URL |
|---------------|--------------|
| Production    | `https://your-domain.tld/studiocms_api/auth/<provider>/callback` |
| Testing & Dev | `http://localhost:4321/studiocms_api/auth/<provider>/callback` |

##### Example callback URL paths

The following paths are examples of the callback URL for each provider:

| Provider | Callback PATH |
|----------|---------------|
| [GitHub](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-github/)   | `/studiocms_api/auth/github/callback` |
| [Discord](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-discord/) | `/studiocms_api/auth/discord/callback` |
| [Google](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-google/)   | `/studiocms_api/auth/google/callback` |
| [Auth0](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-auth0/)     | `/studiocms_api/auth/auth0/callback` |

### Configure Storage API Manager (optional) <Badge text='Added in v0.1.0' variant='success' />

StudioCMS supports using different Storage API Managers to handle file and image storage. By default, StudioCMS uses a built-in no-op storage manager that does not store any files or images.

To configure a different Storage API Manager, you will need to install the appropriate plugin and configure it in your `studiocms.config.mjs` file.

<ReadMore>For more information about the Storage API see, [Storage API Docs](/en/storage-api/)</ReadMore>
<ReadMore>For available storage manager plugins, see the [Package catalog](/en/package-catalog#storage-managers).</ReadMore>

#### Example: Configure S3 Storage Manager

<Steps>

1. Install the `@studiocms/s3-storage` plugin:

   <PackageManagers type='add' pkg='@studiocms/s3-storage' />

2. Update your `studiocms.config.mjs` file to use the S3 Storage Manager:

   ```ts title="studiocms.config.mjs" ins={2, 5}
   import { defineStudioCMSConfig } from 'studiocms/config';
   import s3Storage from '@studiocms/s3-storage';

   export default defineStudioCMSConfig({
      storageManager: s3Storage(),
   });
   ```

3. Set the required environment variables for the S3 Storage Manager in your `.env` file:

   <Aside type="tip" title="Supported S3 Providers">
   StudioCMS's S3 Storage Manager is built using the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` package, which supports any S3-compatible storage provider, including AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO, and others.
   </Aside>

   ```sh title=".env"
   CMS_S3_PROVIDER=ExampleS3Provider
   CMS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id>
   CMS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
   CMS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket-name>
   # CMS_S3_ENDPOINT= # Optional: Specify a custom endpoint if required by your provider
   # CMS_S3_REGION= # Optional: Specify the region if required by your provider
   # CMS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE= # Optional: Use path-style URLs for S3 objects
   # CMS_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT= # Optional: Custom public endpoint for accessing files
   ```

   <ReadMore>For more information about the Environment variables with the S3 Storage Manager see, [S3 Storage: Environment Variables](/en/package-catalog/storage-managers/s3-storage/#environment-variable-examples)</ReadMore>

</Steps>

### Configure your `package.json` scripts

Setup your `package.json` scripts to include the following StudioCMS commands for easier use:

```json title="package.json" {7-8}
{
    "name": "my-studiocms-project",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "astro dev",
        "build": "astro check & astro build",
        "astro": "astro",
        "migrate": "studiocms migrate",
        "studiocms": "studiocms",
    }
}
```

## Running your StudioCMS project

Thanks to the power of Astro running StudioCMS is as easy as running the dev command for local preview, or building and deploying to your server, for the basics of how to use it locally without building here is what you need to do.

### First time Setup (or during updates if the tables schema is updated)

To start your Astro project, run the following commands in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="studiocms migrate --latest" />
    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

After running the commands, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. When first setting up StudioCMS, you will prompted to finish configuring StudioCMS at `http://localhost:4321/start`

### Running in Astro Development mode locally

To start your Astro project, run the following command in your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

After running the command, you should see a message indicating that your project is running at `localhost:4321`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see your Astro project in action.

You can access the StudioCMS dashboard at `http://localhost:4321/dashboard` by default to manage your content and settings.

**Congratulations!** 🥳 You now have StudioCMS installed in your Astro project.

### Adding a frontend to your StudioCMS project

StudioCMS is a headless Astro CMS, which means you have to provide your own frontend to display the content. If you are looking for a frontend that is already built, you can checkout our plugins in the [Package Catalog][package-catalog].

#### Setup a blog

For example if you want to build a blog using StudioCMS, you can use the [`@studiocms/blog`](/en/package-catalog/studiocms-plugins/studiocms-blog/) plugin to get started quickly without having to build everything from scratch. This plugin provides a simple blog frontend that removes the need to have any source files for your frontend pages.

To install and setup the blog plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

<PackageManagers type="install" pkg="@studiocms/blog" />

After installing the plugin, you will need to add the plugin to your `studiocms.config.mjs` file:

```ts twoslash title="studiocms.config.mjs"
import { defineStudioCMSConfig } from 'studiocms/config';
import blog from '@studiocms/blog';

export default defineStudioCMSConfig({
    dbStartPage: false,
    plugins: [
        blog(),
    ],
});
```

#### Building a custom frontend

If you want to build a custom frontend for your StudioCMS project, you can use the [StudioCMS SDK](/en/how-it-works/sdk/) or [StudioCMS RestAPI](/en/how-it-works/restapi/) to fetch and a [StudioCMS Rendering plugin](/en/plugins/renderers/) to render content from StudioCMS on your custom pages.

<ReadMore>
If you want to build a custom frontend for your StudioCMS project, you can use the [StudioCMS Renderer component and SDK](/en/guides/custom-frontend/rendering/) to render the content from StudioCMS on your custom pages.
</ReadMore>

<ReadMore>
See the [Custom Frontend Guides](/en/guides/#custom-frontend-guides) for more guides and tutorials on building a custom frontend with StudioCMS.
</ReadMore>

### Building and deploying your StudioCMS project

After running the [first time setup steps](#first-time-setup-or-during-updates-if-the-tables-schema-is-updated), you should build and deploy your StudioCMS project to your server.

By default, StudioCMS's dashboard is available at `http://your-domain.tld/dashboard`.

This dashboard will be available for you to manage your content and settings in development mode and production mode. 

It is recommended to use StudioCMS in production mode only, as the dashboard is meant to be used by the built project. (You may see some issues/errors in development mode such as a Vite dep error.)
