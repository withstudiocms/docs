NOTE: The following code used to be included in a script tag on the page.
However, our english translations are now far more developed than any other language.
We are going to start a process of updating our translations, and can begin to opt-in
to different language automatic redirects once they hit a certain quality threshold.
Until then, we'll just only redirect to english for now, with the meta tag below
